#+TITLE: Convert HTML files to org-mode

This converts your html file to org-mode focusing on keeping the
formatted text (no embedded span or div in the output) based on
google's [[https://github.com/google/gumbo-parser][gumbo]] parser. It
comes in two version (Python and Nim) which are kept in sync (does the
same thing) as much as possible.

* Usage
  - Install ~gumbo~
  - Run your executable of choice with one html file (or url) as argument. Output org-mode file goes to stdout.
** python

  - Install the gumbo-parser python binding

#+BEGIN_SRC shell
pip install gumbo (--user)
#+END_SRC

** nim

  - To compile the nim executable
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
cd nim
nim c html_to_org.nim
#+END_SRC

* todo
  - handle HTML anchor/fragment links
    - probably need a uid for each header
  - fix wrong wrap in nim's version
